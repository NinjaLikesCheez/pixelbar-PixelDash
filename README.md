# Pixelbar Dashboard

A rewrite of the original pygame-based PixelLight touchscreen interface to the PixelBar domotics

This is very much a work in progress

## Setup

1. Ensure python 3.10 or greater is installed
2. Create a config by copying `config/pixeldash.toml.example` to `config/pixeldash.toml`
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the program `python __main__.py`
